# Basic code for reading values from a CSV file and executing a copy function on all files with the document type
import pandas as pd
import shutil
import os.path
from datetime import datetime 

# store the datetime variable to use 
now = datetime.now()

# set each specific date valeu as its own variable 
curr_day = now.day()
curr_month = (now.month() + ' ' + now.strftime('%B'))
curr_year = now.year()
# locate within the directory for the specific year 

# locate the month needed

# locate the day 

# read from the specific CSV
data = pd.read_csv("testbook.csv")

#  set file_types to search key values 
file_types = ['Deeds', 'PCORS', 'AFF'] 

# filter the rows where the 'Type' of the document contains the file_types values
filtered_data = data[data['Type'].isin(file_types)]

# create a variable with the file path of the destination folder 
copy_folder = r"file_path"

# iterate through the rows in the filtered_data 
# have to verify how the file storage are set for the TIFFs, since I believe from testing 
# the test files may be in the same directory as the CSV. Possibility of being able to search thru a folder
# to copy the files from, since the fiels are stored in notated folders 
# lookup process may look like 
# 1. read the date to go the corresponding folder 
# looking at the shutil module it states that you can set the src and dst
